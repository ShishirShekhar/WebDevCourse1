# Full Stack from Zero: Course Workspace

Welcome to the teaching workspace for the **Full Stack from Zero: The Complete MERN Journey**. This repo contains the lesson materials, example pages, and supporting files used in class. Use it as a starting point to follow along, experiment, and extend the examples.

## Repo layout

- `Syllabus.md` — detailed topic checklist for the course.
- `Day1/` — introductory HTML examples (`index.html`, `hello.html`).
- `Day2/` — form and data examples (`contact.html`, `signup.html`, `getdata.html`).

## Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge).
- Basic text editor (VS Code recommended).

## How to use

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/ShishirShekhar/WebDevCourse1.git`
2. Open the folder in VS Code: `code WebDevCourse1`
3. Open any `.html` file and use the built-in Live Server extension or just double-click to view in your browser.
4. Edit and experiment with the HTML/CSS/JS as you learn each topic.

## Suggested flow

- Review `Syllabus.md` to track progress and mark off completed items.
- Walk through the Day 1 files to revisit core HTML structure and semantics.
- Practice form handling with the Day 2 examples.
- Add your own examples in new day folders as the course advances (CSS, JavaScript, Node/Express, MongoDB, React).

## Updating the syllabus

Use checkboxes in `Syllabus.md` to track completion. Example:

- `[x]` completed
- `[ ]` pending
